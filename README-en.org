#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'scp)
#+END_SRC
** Linux dependent environment

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
apt-get install sshpass

* Configuration of the sample
** Connection information Settings
Use .dir-locals.el to set the connection information for the current project
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
((nil
  (host ."127.0.0.1")
  (user ."username")
  (password ."password")
  (remote_path ."/www") ;;Remote server engineering path 
  (port ."22")
))
#+END_SRC
Therefore, you need to read the variables and suggest joining before you introduce scp.el
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq enable-local-variables :all enable-local-eval t)
  (hack-dir-local-variables)
#+END_SRC
